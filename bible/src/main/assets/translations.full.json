In 1870, an invitation was extended to American religious leaders for scholars to work on the RV project. A year later, Protestant theologian Philip Schaff chose 30 scholars representing the denominations of Baptist, Congregationalist, Dutch Reformed, Friends, Methodist, Episcopal, Presbyterian, Protestant Episcopal, and Unitarian. These scholars began work in 1872.</p><p>The RV New Testament was released In 1881; the Old Testament was published in 1885. The ASV was published in 1901 by Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons. In 1928, the International Council of Religious Education (the body that later merged with the Federal Council of Churches to form the National Council of Churches) acquired the copyright from Nelson and renewed it the following year.</p><p>The divine name of the Almighty (the Tetragrammaton) is consistently rendered Jehovah in the ASV Old Testament, rather than LORD as it appears in the King James Bible.</p><p>The ASV was the basis of four revisions. They were the Revised Standard Version, 1971, the Amplified Bible, 1965, the New American Standard Bible, 1995, and the Recovery Version, 1999. A fifth revision, known as the World English Bible, was published in 2000 and was placed in the public domain. The ASV was also the basis for Kenneth N. Taylor's Bible paraphrase, The Living Bible, 1971.</p><p>This Bible is in the public domain in the United States.

The BRG Bible advances this idea by printing in heaven‚Äôs color, Blue, the spoken, quotable words of God, the Father; continuing to print the spoken words of Jesus in his blood‚Äôs color, Red; and printing in the color of fire, Gold, the name Holy Ghost (or Holy Spirit), and all references to His name including personal pronouns. With BRG Bible, the quotable words of God, the spoken words of Jesus, and the name of the Holy Ghost are lifted off the page to give a visual recognition to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, the foundation of Christian faith.

Though there are many topics in the Bible, all of them are there to serve the gospel of Christ. All of our work in producing and distributing this translation is directed to the glory of God and to the eternal salvation of people‚Äôs souls.</p><p>Our translation is called <i>Heritage</i> because this word heritage looks to the past, the present, and the future.</p><p><i>Heritage</i> expresses our respect for the generations of Christians and for the faithful translators who have passed the Bible down to us. We are aware that we in the present are building on the foundation which they have laid for us. As the old saying goes: We can see so far because we are standing on the shoulders of giants.</p><p>The term <i>Heritage</i> also looks to the future. The gospel is a precious inheritance that is to be passed from generation to generation until Christ returns. It is our prayer that this translation will have a part in that great mission which the Lord has left for his church. Our goal and motto is expressed in the hymn verse:<blockquote>God‚Äôs Word is our great heritage<br />and shall be ours forever.<br />To spread its light from age to age<br />shall be our chief endeavor.<br />Through life it guides our way.<br />In death it is our stay.<br />Lord, grant, while worlds endure,<br />we keep its teaching pure<br />throughout all generations.</blockquote></p><p>To this end, our goal is to produce a <i>balanced</i> translation, suitable for all-purpose use in the church.</p><p>We seek a balance between the <i>old</i> and the<i> new.</i> We debated whether our translation should be called <i>new</i> or <i>revised.</i> Neither term tells the whole story. Our translation can be called <i>revised</i>or <i>traditional</i> insofar as it builds on the tradition of Bible translation that goes back to the King James Version, to Martin Luther, and beyond. It is <i>new</i> in that it is not based on any one template, and it introduces new terms in those places where the traditional terms no longer communicate clearly.</p><p>We seek a balance between the poles of so-called <i>literal</i> and <i>dynamic equivalent</i> theories of translation. A translator should not adhere too closely to any one theory of translation because literalistic, word-for-word translations sometimes convey the wrong meaning, or they do not communicate clearly in the receiving language. Overly free translations deprive the reader of some of the expressions, imagery, and style of the original.</p><p>We seek a balance between <i>formality</i> and <i>informality.</i> The Bible contains many types of literature and different levels of language, from the very simple to the very difficult. For this reason, the translator should not be too committed to producing one level of language but should try to reproduce the tone or ‚Äúflavor‚Äù of the original.</p><p>The <i>Evangelical Heritage Version</i> is designed for <i>learning and teaching.</i> Our translators assume that their readers have the ability and the desire to learn new biblical words and to deepen their understanding of important biblical terms and concepts. Translators should not be condescending or patronizing toward their readers but should be dedicated to helping them grow. The Bible was written for ordinary people, but it is a literary work with many figures of speech and many rare words. The Bible is a book to be read, but it is also a book to be studied. Our footnotes are designed to assist in the process of learning and teaching. Our translation is in that sense a textbook.</p><p>The <i>Evangelical Heritage Version</i> is <i>not an interpretative translation.</i> On one level, every act of translation involves interpretation, but when we say that the <i>Evangelical Heritage Version</i> strives to avoid importing interpretation into the translation, we mean that our duty and goal is to understand and to reproduce as closely as possible what the original text says and to say no more and no less than what the text says.</p><p>We offer this translation to the church as a balanced translation, suitable for all-purpose use in the church.</p>üîó<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Evangelical-Heritage-Version-EHV-Bible/\">Bible Gateway</a>",

It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 400 years. The King James Version present on the Bible Gateway matches the 1987 printing. The KJV is public domain in the United States.</p>üîó<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/King-James-Version-KJV-Bible/\">Bible Gateway</a>",
